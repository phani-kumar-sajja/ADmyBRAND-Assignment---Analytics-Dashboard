# AI Usage Report

This report summarizes how AI assistants (primarily Google's Gemini) were leveraged to build the ADmyBRAND Insights dashboard.

## AI Tools Used

-   **Primary Tool:** Google Gemini
-   **Secondary Tool(s):** GitHub Copilot (for autocompletion within the IDE)

## Key Use Cases

-   **Architecture & Scaffolding:** Generated the initial Next.js project setup and layout, including the sidebar, header, and theme provider.
-   **Component Generation:** Created boilerplate for all major React components (`StatCard`, `OverviewChart`, `TrafficSourceChart`, `DataTable`).
-   **Problem-Solving & Debugging:** Diagnosed and fixed complex issues, such as the Recharts hydration error, by suggesting solutions like dynamic imports and client components (`"use client"`).
-   **Code Refactoring:** Provided cleaner, more robust versions of code snippets, such as the fix for the chart's line rendering.
-   **Best Practices:** Recommended and implemented modern development patterns like responsive grids, loading skeletons, and a component-based architecture.

## Sample Prompts

1.  "Create a responsive React dashboard component using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui. The component should be a line chart using Recharts to display monthly revenue data. Make sure it's responsive and supports dark mode by using CSS variables for colors."
2.  "My Recharts line chart is not rendering the line, only the axes, in a Next.js App Router project. The component is dynamically imported with `ssr: false`, but the bug persists. Provide the updated component code to fix the rendering issue."
3.  "Generate the code for a complex, interactive data table using `@tanstack/react-table` and shadcn/ui components. It needs to support sorting, email filtering, and pagination."

## AI vs. Manual Work Split

-   **AI-Generated (70%):** The initial boilerplate for all components, complex logic for the data table and charts, and solutions for debugging were generated by AI. This dramatically accelerated the development process.
-   **Manual Coding & Customization (30%):** Manual work involved integrating the generated components, tweaking styles to match the design vision, adjusting props, managing file structure, and applying the AI-provided fixes.
